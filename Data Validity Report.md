**The Journey of Building the DataValidityCheck Package**

## **Introduction**
The story of **DataValidityCheck** began as a simple idea: creating a Python package that could effectively validate different types of user-inputted personal data, such as emails, phone numbers, dates, and URLs. The goal was to ensure that data adhered to proper formats, making it useful for applications requiring strong input validation.

## **Phase 1: Conceptualization and Planning**
The initial phase involved defining the core functionality of the package. The plan was to:
- Create a Python class (`DataValidator`) with methods for validating different data types.
- Use **regular expressions (regex)** for validation.
- Package the project following Python packaging standards.
- Write unit tests to ensure correctness.
- Deploy the package to PyPI for public use.

## **Phase 2: Development and Implementation**

### **1. Structuring the Project**
A proper directory structure was set up to align with best practices:
```
DataValidityCheck/
│   validate_info_data.py  # Contains the DataValidator class
│   __init__.py            # Makes the directory a package
│
└───tests/                 # Contains test cases for validation methods
```

The `DataValidator` class was then implemented in **`validate_info_data.py`**, with the following methods:
- `validate_email(email: str) -> bool`
- `validate_phone(phone: str) -> bool`
- `validate_date(date: str) -> bool`
- `validate_url(url: str) -> bool`

### **2. Writing Regular Expressions (Regex)**
Regular expressions were designed to be strict yet flexible enough to handle various input cases. Some challenges included:
- Ensuring valid email formats.
- Handling international and local phone numbers.
- Validating dates in **DD/MM/YYYY** format while considering month-day relationships.
- Checking URL validity, supporting `http`, `https`, and `www`.

The `re.VERBOSE` flag was used in the date validation regex to make it more readable.

### **3. Packaging with Poetry**
Initially, **Poetry** was used for packaging and dependency management. However, issues arose when transitioning to newer Poetry standards. Adjustments were made in `pyproject.toml`, replacing deprecated fields like `[tool.poetry.name]` with `[project.name]`.

### **4. Publishing to PyPI**
After testing, the package was built and uploaded to PyPI using **Twine**:
```sh
poetry build
poetry publish --build
```

Later, updates required deleting old `dist/` files before re-uploading to avoid version conflicts.

## **Phase 3: Challenges and Solutions**

### **1. Import Errors and Module Paths**
- Initially, importing `DataValidator` required long module paths, like:
  ```python
  from DataValidityCheck.validate_info_data import DataValidator
  ```
- The issue was resolved by restructuring the package and ensuring `__init__.py` exposed the class properly.

### **2. GitHub Repository Mistakes**
- A wrong remote repository URL was initially used.
- The correct repository was set up, and branches were used to manage feature updates (`git push origin feature`).

### **3. Handling Twine Upload Issues**
- Older package versions had to be removed from `dist/` before re-uploading.
- The `twine upload` command was used correctly to push updates.

## **Final Thoughts and Future Improvements**
The development of `DataValidityCheck` was a learning experience, combining Python best practices, regex mastery, and package deployment. Future improvements could include:
- Expanding validation methods (e.g., credit card numbers, addresses).
- Enhancing test coverage.
- Providing a CLI tool for easy validation.

**This journey demonstrated the power of structured software development and the importance of meticulous package management.**
